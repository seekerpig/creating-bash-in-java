# creating-bash-in-java
 
## Goal of this project
1. Implement Bash using Java
- This includes not only implementing commands from cat, grep, tee, echo, ls and more.
- But also being able to combine all these commands together in advanced manners such as ls | grep
- Purpose is to learn how CLI tools like bash works by building it.
2. Learning how to test software comprehensively (unit tests, integration tests, mutation tests and more!)


A shell is a command interpreter. Its responsibility is to interpret commands that the user types and to run programs that the user specifies in her command lines. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the shell, the kernel, and various applications/utilities in a UNIX-like operating system:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c22c8546-6329-480c-bf3b-f49e587ec598)
